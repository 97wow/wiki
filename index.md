# Welcome to git-wiki demo

This is a [demo](wiki/Demo.md) of git-wiki theme for jekyll

it's a full featured wiki that powered by git, github pages and pull-requests!

It means: 

* Better collaboration possibilities instead of integrated github wiki, thanks to forks, pull-requests and roles.
* You can customize your wiki as you want with stylesheets and even change the layout
* No database! just static files that can be downloaded in few seconds
* Markdown and html mixed together!
* History, commits, and everything you need from a wiki platform
* You can edit pages with standard git editor, prose.io (integrated) or any kind of editor you prefere.

You can fork/copy the master branch now and start your wiki in just 1 minute.

Then please, [share your wiki with us!](wiki/Showreel.md)

**Note:**
You can even include the github wiki as a submodule and enable the conf, but it's an experimental feature and has few advantages but various drawbacks.

## Current known limitations

* Unexistant wiki page links are not "red".

* You can't use the wiki link format: [[example]] , but you should use gh-pages links instead: \[example\](example)
